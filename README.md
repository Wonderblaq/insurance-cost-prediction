Insurance Cost Prediction (TensorFlow)

This project predicts medical insurance costs using a neural network built with TensorFlow and Keras.
The model learns patterns from features like age, BMI, children, smoker status, sex, and region to estimate insurance charges.

🧩 Steps:

Preprocessed data (one-hot encoding + standardization)

Split dataset into training and test sets

Built and trained a deep learning regression model

Tuned hyperparameters using RandomizedSearchCV

⚙️ Tech Stack:

TensorFlow • Keras • Pandas • NumPy • Scikit-learn

📈 Goal:

Accurately predict insurance costs and understand how personal factors influence medical expenses.
